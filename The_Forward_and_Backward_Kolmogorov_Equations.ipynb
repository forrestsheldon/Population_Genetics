      "We consider the evolution of **Markov Processes**, or those whose statistics/transition probabilities depend only on the current state of the system.

Many times, a process that is not Markovian can be recast as one that is when more parameters of the system are included.\n",

These could also potentially depend on $t$ but for now we suppress the dependence, requiring that our processes be stationary.  We can also see, from the symmetry of the integral, that the diffusion tensor is symmetric."
